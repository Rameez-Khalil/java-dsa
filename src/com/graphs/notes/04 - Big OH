SPACE COMPLEX:
    Adjacency Matrix: O(V^2) //vertex and the others as 0.
    Adjacency List: O(V + E) //vertex and its edges.

If we are to add another vertex then.

    ADDING VERTEX:

    Adjacency Matrix: we will need to add another row/col.
    Adjacency List: Only a key value pair will be added.

    ADDING EDGE:
    For some reasons, both are O(1) when adding an EDGE.

    REMOVING EDGE:
    Adjacency Matrix: O(1).
    Adjacency List: O(N). //since we will need to loop through the array.

    REMOVING VERTEX:
        Adjacency Matrix: O(V^2).
        Adjacency List: O(V+E).
