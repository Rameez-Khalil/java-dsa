ADD VERTEX:
    1. Create a hashmap that will store key as a string and the corresponding array list.
        private HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> adjacencyList = new HashMap();

    2.  Create a method which will take a vertex as a string parameter.
        Check to see if the provided vertex isn't in our hashmap.
        If null then put our vertex as a key and generate its container for the vertices it is storing.


        public boolean addVertex(String key){
            if(adjacencyList.get(vertex)==null{
                adjacencyList.put(vertex, new ArrayList<String>());
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }
