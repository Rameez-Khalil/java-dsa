        Create a method named removeEdge accepting two string parameters.
        Under the function body, check to see if two vertices exist.
        Find the list for vertex1 and remove vertex2 occurrences from it.
        Repeat the above process for vertex2.
        Return true.

        //If vertices weren't located then return false.
