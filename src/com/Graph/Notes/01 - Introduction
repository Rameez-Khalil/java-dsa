VERTEX:
    1. Vertex is equivalent to Node.
    2. Between the vertices we have a connection/edge.
    3. There is no limit to how many other vertices a vertex can be connected to.
    4. HOP is a unit of traversing.
    5. This is very helpful, suppose you want to go from A->B, the direct cost is 15 due to traffic and
    the other way which is A->C->B has a cost of 5.


EDGE:
    Used to determine the connection between vertices.
    Waited Edge is uni-directional (You are following a celebrity but they don't follow you back).
    Non-Waited Ege is bidirectional (You and your friend are following you).



TREE VS GRAPH VS LINKED LIST.
    Trees are a form of graph, with a limitation that each node will point to max two other nodes.
    LinkedList are used to implement Trees.
    Hence, Trees are a form of graph, and linked list is a form of a tree, therefore,  LinkedList is also a form of a
    graph.
