REMOVE VERTEX:
        1. The beauty of bidirectional edges is just by looking at the vertex and its associated vertices,
        we can identify how many edges to be removed.
            e.g. D = [A,B,C]
            we can clearly identify that D is associated with A, B and C. Also A, B, C has a connection pointing to D.

        2. Create a function named removeVertex accepting a string parameter i.e. vertex.
            Inside the body of the function check to see if our vertex exist in our list using get method.
            Loop through the arrayList against our vertex and for every item present in it loop its arrayList and remove
            the occurrence of the provided vertex.

            public boolean removeVertex(String vertex){
                if(adjacencyList.get(vertex)==null return false.
                for(String connectedVertex : adjacencyList.get(vertex){
                    adjacencyList.get(connectedVertex).remove(vertex);
                }
                adjacencyList.remove(vertex);
                return true;
            }
