DP works on the basis of memoization.
Each problem can be further divided into sub problems
Divide until it cannot be further divided, in such a way that each problem can be solved independently.

Since we do share some areas in our problems, we store the already solved area.
This is known as overlapping sub-problems.


DP - There is some area that overlaps.
Divide and Conquer - The problems are independent.



GREEDY APPROACH -
    When we already know the path to acquire the solution.
    We fix our path.

Consider 1,5,7 target sum is 18.


GREEDY APPROACH.
1st approach:
7*2= 14.
1*4 = 4.
this will result 6 steps.

2nd approach:

7*1 = 7.
5*2 = 10
1*1 = 1.

this will result 4 steps.
