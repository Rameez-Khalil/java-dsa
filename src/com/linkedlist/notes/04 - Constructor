APPROACH:
    1. Since our helper method (Append, prepend, insert etc.) all of thse
    are creating nodes, so we will create an inner class.
    2. Since its a good practice to make class members private
    where we can, so we will follow that rule of thumb.


    ALGO:
        1. Create a linked list class.
        2. create LL class members (length, head and tail).
        3. create an inner class (Node) along with the initializer.
        4. Initialize LL with the help of constructor and set the
        members appropriately.
