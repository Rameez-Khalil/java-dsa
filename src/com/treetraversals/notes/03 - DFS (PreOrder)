There are three types of DFS.
    1. PreOrder (start at the top, keep traverse left until the end).
        Go to the end of the left hand side, once finish reach to the top then go right.
    2. PostOrder.


DFS - PreOrder.

 Traverse until the end (left hand), once you've reached the bottom go to the parent,
 and then traverse the right.

 PREORDER CODING APPROACH:
    1. This is going to be a recursive solution.

    2. Inner class will be used to perform certain sets of operations, mostly, left and right.
    Since java doesn't allow a function to be written inside of another function so we will
    treat new ConstructorName(parameter) as our callback function.

    3. Every node will be put inside of our call stack to check left and right.
        Once done with the left then it will move on to the right.
