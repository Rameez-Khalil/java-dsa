MERGE SORT:
    Cut the array in half.
    Repeat the above step until there is a single item array.
    Pick two of these pieces and compare AND combine.
    Pick a set of two sorted pieces then combine them.

MERGE:
    Merge is our helper function.
    Two sorted arrays gets converted back into one sorted array.
    Under each sorted array out of two:
        1. Take two vars i and j.
        2. Compare i with j, whichever is lower push that item
            into combined array.
        3. As soon as either i or j gets to 0 break out of the loop.
        4. Push the remaining items from which ever had elements left.
