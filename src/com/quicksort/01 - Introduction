QUICK SORT:
    We will work on the basis of pivot point.
    The first item will be considered as pivot.
    After every iteration, everything left to the pivot will be sorted, and to the right will be unsorted.
    After first iteration, run quicksort on the left hand side, and on the right hand side as well.

PIVOT:
    Helper function for quick sort.
    Initialize pivot, swap to the first item, and i to the 2nd item.
    Check the ith value, anytime when we have a smaller value than the pivot, we will move the swap var.
        Swap those two items.

QUICK SORT:
    Call pivot.
    Pivot will rearrange the indexes and will give us back the index.
    This pivotIndex will then be used to apply quicksort on the left and right.
