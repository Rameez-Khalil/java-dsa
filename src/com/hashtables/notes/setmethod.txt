set will be responsible to genrate a node
should accept key and value.
run hash function and set its value as index.
create a node.
check datamap[index]==null if so.
    datamap[index] = newnode.
else:
    assign temp variable at the start of that index.
    traverse until temp's next is not null.
    once found assign temp.next = newnode.
