hash method is going to be private as this is only going to be used by hashmethod class.
We need to structure it in a way that the number should lie under the specified range.

private int hash(String key){
    int hash = 0;
    //convert this key into char array so we can convert every letter into an ascii.
    char[] charArray = key.toCharArray();
    for(int i=0;i<charArray.length;i++){
        //java is smart enough to understand this below statement.
        int asciiValue = charArray[i];
        hash = (hash + asciival*23) % datamap.length;

    }
    return hash;
}
