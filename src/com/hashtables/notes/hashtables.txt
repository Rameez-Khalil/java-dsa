A hashtable is a non-linear ds where we use a hash function to identify the address loc.
We will be storing key-value pairs.
In our case we will be storing hardwares.
hash function will be running against KEY and each letter will then be converted into ASCII.


************************HASH TABLE PROPS****************.
ONE WAY - key will be converted once it is converted we cannot re-evaluate it back.
DETERMINISTIC - whatever the value it provides us for each key will be constant throughout the course.


**********************APPROACH****************
SET METHOD (key, value) - Hash -> address value.
GET METHOD (key) - returns value.
