In this method we will fetch all the keys and store them
in array list and at the end will return that array list.

//Loop through the entire datamap.
//start from 0 and traverse until datamap.length.
//For each datamap[i] make sure to grab all the items.
// for each ith value store temp.key into an arraylist.
