Stack is a linear data structure that works on the basis of LIFO.
You cannot get to the 2nd item without passing by the 3rd.
ADDING AND REMOVING SHOULD BE DONE FROM THE SAME END.

EXAMPLES:
    1.Web browser history.
    2. Can be implemented with linked list / array list.


FOR ARRAY LIST:
    MAKE SURE TO ADD/REMOVE FROM END. O(1).

FOR LINKED LIST:
    ADD/REMOVE FROM BEGINNING O(1).
    RemoveFirst will become pop.
    Prepend will become push.
    We don't need the bottom variable since we don't utilize
    removing/adding from the bottom.
