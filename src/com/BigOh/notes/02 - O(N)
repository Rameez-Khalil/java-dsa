Easiest one to get our head around.
Based off of the length the code will execute.
It will always be a straight line. (Proportional).

Example:
    Suppose you have to print the word Hello N-times.
    The code will then need to execute N number of times.


    This statement will execute N number of times.
    print(i: 0->N){
        sysout("Hello")
    }
