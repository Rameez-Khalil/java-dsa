A way of comparing two sets of codes.
Big Oh is a way of measuring efficiency of different algorithms/codes.

Time Complexity: Is not measured with respect to the time.
Space Complexity: How much memory code acquires.



We need to address both concepts, and based off of the priority we need to
sructure the code.


Best case: if we are finding the 1st position.
Average case : if we are finding the middle element.
Worst case: if we are finding the last element.
